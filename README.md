This Python program is for an Outdoor Park Concert App. It helps manage ticket sales for the concert. You can check available seats, buy tickets, search for tickets by name, and see a list of all purchases. The seating arrangement ensures there are two empty seats between occupied ones in each row. When you buy a ticket, the program calculates the price based on the seat type and adds taxes and a mask fee. It stores purchase data using JSON files and can generate receipts. It's easy to use and helps organize concert tickets efficiently.
