Outdoor Park Concert App
This Python program is designed to facilitate ticket sales and management for an outdoor park concert. It offers various features to help users view available seating, purchase tickets, search for tickets by name, and display all purchases.

Features
View Seating: Users can view the available seating arrangement for the concert. Each seat is represented by a lowercase 'a' for available seats and 'X' for occupied seats.
Purchase Tickets: Users can buy tickets for the concert. They can specify the number of tickets, seat type (Front, Middle, or Back), and provide their name and email for the purchase.
Search by Name: Users can search for tickets purchased under a specific name. The program will display the seats reserved by that individual.
Display Purchases: Users can view a list of all purchases made for the concert, along with the total income generated from ticket sales.
Seat Distancing: The program ensures that there are two empty seats between occupied ones in each row, maintaining social distancing guidelines.
Receipt Generation: Upon purchasing tickets, the program generates a receipt containing the buyer's name, email, number of tickets, ticket type, and total price.
Data Storage: Purchase data is stored in JSON files, allowing for easy retrieval and management of ticket sales information.
User-Friendly Interface: The program provides a simple menu-based interface for easy navigation and interaction.
